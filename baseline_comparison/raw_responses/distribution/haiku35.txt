I've reviewed the Distribution Agreement, and here are some key observations:

Strengths:
1. Comprehensive coverage of distribution relationship details
2. Clear definitions of terms
3. Specific provisions for pricing, minimum purchases, and territories
4. Trademark usage guidelines
5. Liability limitations
6. Confidentiality provisions

Key Potential Concerns:
1. Non-exclusive distribution arrangement allows Supplier significant flexibility
2. Minimum purchase requirement ($100,000 per quarter) might be challenging
3. Supplier has broad rights to modify prices and sell directly to customers
4. Limited warranty period (12 months)
5. Arbitration in Chicago might disadvantage non-local Distributor

Notable Clauses:
- Non-exclusive distribution (Article 3)
- Minimum purchase commitment (Article 6)
- Trademark license (Article 8)
- Liability limitations (Article 10)
- Termination provisions (Article 11)

Recommendations:
1. Negotiate more favorable minimum purchase terms
2. Clarify specific territory boundaries
3. Review product specifications carefully
4. Consider negotiating more distributor protections
5. Ensure all exhibits are thoroughly completed

Overall, this is a standard distribution agreement with balanced provisions, but the Distributor should carefully review terms before signing.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section?
