Certainly! Here’s a **review of your Distribution Agreement**, highlighting strengths, potential risks, and practical suggestions. *This is not formal legal advice, but a contract lawyer should review your specific situation and goals for refinement before execution.*

---
## **Key Strengths**
- **Well-defined Structure:** The agreement covers major points needed for a distribution deal (definitions, territory, orders, pricing, marketing, IP, warranties, limitations, term & termination, confidentiality, dispute resolution, etc.).
- **Exhibits Referenced:** Products, specifications, territory, and trademarks are all attached as exhibits, which keeps the main contract streamlined.
- **Clear Minimum Purchase Requirement:** Quantifies expectations and the mechanism for breach (with two consecutive quarters of deficiency triggering rights).
- **Limitation of Liability:** Reasonable attempt to cap commercial risk for both parties.
- **Arbitration for Dispute Resolution:** Avoids court litigation, which can be more costly and public.

---
## **Potential Risks, Ambiguities, and Points for Clarification**

### **1. Key Exhibits Are Missing**
- **RISKS:** The main contract references Exhibits A-D (Products, Specifications, Territory, Trademarks). If these are not thoroughly described, you can have major ambiguity and disputes.
- **SUGGESTION:** Attach these exhibits and ensure both parties review and initial each. Territory in particular should be geographically clear.

---

### **2. Exclusivity and Competition**
- **Non-Exclusivity (3.1, 3.2):** Supplier reserves broad rights to appoint other distributors and even sell directly, possibly undercutting the Distributor.
    - *If you are the Distributor, consider negotiating for limited exclusivity, or at least right of first refusal for new customers.*
    - *If you are Supplier, this preserves flexibility but can disincentivize Distributor investment.*
---

### **3. Minimum Purchase (6.1)**
- **CONSEQUENCES:** Failure to purchase $100K/quarter for two quarters is a "material breach," but the *remedies* (e.g. immediate termination?) are not specified except general termination for cause (11.2).
    - *SUGGESTION:* Explicitly state what happens—notice period, cure rights, or immediate right of termination.

---

### **4. Payment Terms (5.3)**
- **Late Payments:** 1.5% per month (18% APR) interest on overdue accounts.
    - *Check local usury laws; 1.5%/month is typical, but make sure it’s not deemed excessive in your jurisdictions.*
    - Consider adding right to suspend orders if Distributor is late for X days.

---

### **5. Warranty (9.1, 9.2) and Liability (10)**
- **Warranty Disclaimer:** Standard, but out-of-pocket risks for end-customer complaints, recalls, or regulatory issues are not described.
- **Limitation of Liability:** Caps liability to 12 months of Distributor’s payments—a standard clause, but broad wording on types of damages excluded (no “gross negligence or willful misconduct carve-out”).
    - *Distributors may want exceptions for gross negligence, IP infringement, or willful misconduct.*

---

### **6. Term & Termination (11)**
- **Automatic Renewal:** Agreement auto-renews and can be terminated for non-renewal with 90 days’ notice.
- **Termination for Cause:** General, but no specific reference to bankruptcy/insolvency, breach of confidentiality, IP misuse, etc.
- **Effect of Termination (11.3):** Allows sell-off of inventory for 90 days; what about assistance in winding down, buy-backs, or returning marketing materials?
    - *Consider clarifying certain post-termination obligations (return of samples, customer lists, support on transition, etc.).*

---

### **7. Confidentiality (12)**
- **Duration:** 3 years post-termination coverage; may be short for certain trade secrets.
    - Consider “trade secrets survive as long as they remain trade secrets under law.”

---

### **8. Assignment (13.3)**
- **Distributor cannot assign without Supplier’s consent.** Supplier is silent; does this mean Supplier *can* assign freely? If not intended, clarify.
    - Consider bilateral assignment restrictions unless it’s an affiliate or sale of substantially all assets.

---

### **9. Dispute Resolution (13.2)**
- **Arbitration location:** Chicago, Illinois. *Can pose cost and convenience issues for non-local parties; confirm both are comfortable.*

---

### **10. Governing Law (13.1)**
- **Illinois law** governs. No reference to international sales conventions (e.g., CISG), which may step in by default if parties are in different countries.
    - Add a statement excluding CISG applicability, if not desired.

---

### **11. Miscellaneous**
- **No force majeure notification requirements:** Consider requiring the impacted party to notify the other promptly of events.
- **No express obligation for Supplier to maintain adequate inventory/lead-time.** Especially important for Distributors.
- **No non-compete:** Distributor could theoretically distribute competing products. OK for non-exclusive but may be worth reviewing.

---

## **Sample Additional Clauses/Suggestions**
- **Add mutual indemnification** for third-party claims arising from breach of law, IP infringement, gross negligence, etc.
- **Specify process for price increases**—can Distributor cancel orders pending fulfillment or deliveries if a price hike is imposed?
- **Clarify audit rights**: Does Supplier have right to audit Distributor’s sales, returns, and compliance with territory?
- **Define required insurance** obligations for each side (product liability, commercial general liability).
