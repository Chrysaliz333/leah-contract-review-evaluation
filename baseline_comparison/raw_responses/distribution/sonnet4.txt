### **Overall Assessment**
This is a reasonably well-structured distribution agreement that covers most essential elements. However, there are several areas requiring attention before execution.

## **KEY ISSUES & RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES**

1. **Missing Key Definitions**
   - "Confidential Information" is referenced but never defined (Article 12)
   - "Specifications" mentioned in warranty section but not defined
   - "Term" used throughout but not formally defined

2. **Incomplete Exhibits**
   - All exhibits (A-D) are placeholders - ensure these are completed before signing
   - Note: Exhibit B (Specifications) is referenced but not mentioned in definitions

3. **Ambiguous Warranty Coverage**
   - Section 9.1 references undefined "Specifications"
   - Warranty period starts from "delivery" but delivery point varies based on shipping terms

### **🟡 MODERATE CONCERNS**

4. **Harsh Minimum Purchase Requirements**
   - $400K annual minimum ($100K quarterly) may be excessive
   - Two consecutive quarter failures = material breach is strict
   - Consider graduated penalties or cure periods

5. **Broad Supplier Rights**
   - Supplier retains extensive rights to compete directly (Section 3.2)
   - 60-day price change notice may be insufficient for Distributor planning
   - No price increase limitations or caps

6. **Termination Provisions**
   - 30-day cure period may be insufficient for complex breaches
   - 90-day sell-off period could be inadequate for inventory liquidation
   - No termination compensation for non-cause termination

### **🟢 MINOR IMPROVEMENTS**

7. **Payment Terms**
   - 1.5% monthly interest (18% APR) is reasonable but confirm local usury laws
   - Consider adding dispute resolution for pricing disagreements

8. **Territory Restrictions**
   - "Actively solicit" language in Section 3.3 is subjective
   - Define passive vs. active sales more clearly

## **MISSING PROVISIONS TO CONSIDER**

- **Indemnification clauses** (product liability, IP infringement)
- **Insurance requirements** for Distributor
- **Performance standards** beyond minimum purchases
- **Inventory management** obligations
- **Customer data** ownership and sharing
- **Compliance** with applicable laws and regulations
- **Notice provisions** (how/where to send notices)

## **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**

### **Before Signing:**
1. ✅ Complete all exhibits with specific details
2. ✅ Define all referenced but undefined terms
3. ✅ Negotiate minimum purchase requirements based on market reality
4. ✅ Consider adding indemnification provisions
5. ✅ Clarify warranty specifications reference

### **Consider Negotiating:**
- Graduated penalties for purchase shortfalls

## **LEGAL COMPLIANCE NOTES**
- Arbitration clause appears enforceable under Illinois law
- FOB terms are standard but ensure compliance with Incoterms
