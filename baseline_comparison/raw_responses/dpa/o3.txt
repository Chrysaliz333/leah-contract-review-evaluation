DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENT – HIGH-LEVEL REVIEW  
(Assumes UK-GDPR is the primary regime; comments are equally relevant to EU GDPR unless stated otherwise)

1. Formalities & Structure  
   • Good practice: The DPA is separated from the “Principal Agreement,” contains standard definitions, incorporates Exhibits for particulars, and states primacy over conflicting terms (clause 11.2).  
   • Gaps: The parties’ names, dates, Exhibits A-C and the Effective Date are all blank; ensure they are completed and incorporated by reference in the Principal Agreement to avoid arguments that the DPA never became operative.

2. Mandatory UK-GDPR Article 28(3) Requirements  
   Article 28(3) lists eight elements that must be in a processor agreement. The draft covers most but is silent or thin in some areas:  
   a. Subject-matter, duration, nature, purpose, type of data, categories of data subjects – Provided via Exhibit A but must be completed.  
   b. Documented instructions – Present (2.3) but would benefit from wording that allows Controller to issue further instructions in writing (including email) and clarifies the consequences if Processor believes an instruction is unlawful.  
   c. Confidentiality – Present (3.2).  
   d. Security measures – Clause 5, but Exhibit B is blank; Article 28(3)(c) requires the measures be “set out,” not merely referenced. Add an annex that is specific (e.g., encryption standards, key management, backup, physical security).  
   e. Sub-processor flow-down – Present (4.2) but should state that the same data-protection obligations “as set forth in this DPA” are imposed, not merely “equivalent.”  
   f. Data Subject rights assistance – Present (3.3) but does not address cost allocation or timelines; consider adding “within 5 business days” and “reasonable, documented costs borne by Controller.”  
   g. Breach notification – Present (Art. 8) and timeline (72 hrs) is compliant.  
   h. Data deletion/return – Present (3.4) but Article 28(3)(g) also requires Processor to delete any existing copies unless law requires storage. Add certification requirement (“Processor shall certify in writing…”).

3. Security (Article 32)  
   • Clause 5.1 is appropriately high-level, but merely referencing “encryption, pseudonymisation, access controls” may be deemed insufficient by some regulators; add measurable details in Exhibit B.  
   • Clause 5.2 commits Processor to maintain ISO 27001 certification “or equivalent.” This is strong for Controller but demanding for Processor; if the certification lapses, the Processor would be in breach. Consider softer language: “shall maintain ISO 27001 certification or, if not feasible, an equivalent industry-recognized standard…”.

4. Sub-processor Regime (Art. 28(2))  
   • Controller has 30 days to object (4.1). Add objective criteria for objection (“objection based on reasonable, demonstrable grounds related to data protection”) to avoid frivolous blocking.  
   • Consider requiring Processor to provide a mechanism (portal or email list) to notify changes.  
   • Exhibit C must list initial sub-processors (hosting provider, email relay, etc.); blank list may invalidate “general” authorization.

5. International Transfers (Art. 46)  
   • 6.2 references “Standard Contractual Clauses.” Since Brexit, transfers from the UK require (i) the UK Addendum to the EU SCCs or (ii) the UK IDTA. Add wording to that effect.  
   • If Controller itself is outside the UK/EEA, confirm which party acts as exporter and ensure the correct transfer mechanism is referenced.  
   • Include an obligation to inform Controller if a transfer mechanism is no longer valid (“Schrems II”-type wording) and to cooperate in adopting an alternative safeguard.

6. Audit & Compliance  
   • 7.1 “make available all information necessary” mirrors Art. 28(3)(h).  
   • 7.2 limits audits to “once per year.” Regulators often recommend exceptions: “more frequently if required by a supervisory authority, a Personal Data Breach, or reasonable indication of non-compliance.”  
   • Optionally allow Processor to provide recent SOC 2 / ISO reports as an alternative to on-site audits, reducing burden.

7. Liability & Indemnity  
   • Clause 9 leaves liability “in accordance with applicable law” but then adds an unlimited indemnity in 9.2. This is commercially aggressive and may be unenforceable or hotly negotiated. Typical market positions:  
        – Mutual indemnity limited to a cap (e.g., 12 months’ fees); or  
        – Each party liable only to the extent it violated the DPA; fines attributable to one party are borne by that party.  
   • Clarify whether consequential, indirect, or lost-profit damages are excluded or capped.

8. Costs & Fees  
   • Assistance under 3.3, audits (7.2), and breach cooperation (8.3) are at Processor’s expense by default. Often parties agree that Controller reimburses Processor’s “reasonable and documented” costs beyond a fixed baseline. If desired, add.

9. Term & Termination  
   • 10.2 lists clauses that survive, but security (5), audit (7) and international transfers (6) often survive until deletion is certified.  
   • Add explicit “Certification of Deletion” language and a time-frame (e.g., 30 days after termination).

10. Miscellaneous Clauses Missing or Needing Clarification  
   • Order of precedence should reference any country-specific standard clauses (SCCs/IDTA) taking precedence over the DPA if contradictory.  
   • “Variation due to legal change” – include a clause allowing unilateral change if required to comply with new laws, subject to written notice.  
   • Insurance – consider requiring Processor to maintain cyber liability insurance with a specified limit.  
   • Records of Processing (Art. 30(2)) – Processor should undertake to maintain records and make them available on request.

11. Commercial Points  
   • ISO 27001 promise, unlimited indemnity, and annual audit rights favor the Controller and may be resisted by Processor.  
   • If the parties expect large data volumes or sensitive data (special-category), add:  
        – Data Protection Impact Assessment cooperation clause.  
        – “No sale or use for advertising/analytics” language.  
        – Requirement to notify Controller of any legally binding request for disclosure (government access).

12. Exhibit Completion Checklist  
   Exhibit A – must be filled out and granular:  
        • Example types: name, email, IP, payment data, HR data, special-category data (health data, biometrics) – if yes, tick explicit Article 9 safeguards.  
        • Purpose: hosting SaaS, payroll outsourcing, marketing automation, etc.  
        • Retention period: either specific or “until deletion on termination.”  
   Exhibit B – include:  
        • Infrastructure security (data-centre certifications, network segregation).  
        • Access controls (MFA, RBAC, least privilege).  
        • Encryption (TLS1.2+, AES-256 at rest, key management).  
        • Vulnerability management (patch cadence, penetration tests).  
        • Business continuity and disaster recovery (RPO/RTO).  
        • Logging and monitoring (SIEM, retention period).  
   Exhibit C – list by legal entity, location, purpose, contact. Example: “Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL (Ireland) – IaaS hosting.”

13. Signature Formalities  
   • If either party signs electronically, confirm that local law accepts e-signatures and store copies.  
   • Tie the DPA’s Effective Date to either the Principal Agreement or the last signature date to avoid gaps.

14. Regulatory Guidance & Best Practice References  
   • ICO “Guide to the UK GDPR – Contracts and Liabilities Between Controllers and Processors.”  
   • EDPB Guidelines 07/2020 on SCCs.  
   • ISO/IEC 27018 for cloud privacy controls (optional).

Summary of Key Recommendations  
   1. Complete Exhibits with specific, granular information.  
   2. Add detailed Technical and Organisational Measures.  
   3. Flesh out international transfer mechanisms (UK Addendum/IDTA).  
   4. Revisit indemnity and liability caps to align with commercial risk.  
   5. Expand audit clause to allow additional audits in defined circumstances and permit provision of third-party certifications.  
   6. Insert certification of deletion and clarify survival clauses.  
   7. Provide a mechanism and criteria for objection to new Sub-processors.  
   8. Clarify cost allocation for assistance and audits.

Implementing the above will reduce legal and operational risk for both parties and bring the DPA fully in line with UK/EU regulatory expectations.
