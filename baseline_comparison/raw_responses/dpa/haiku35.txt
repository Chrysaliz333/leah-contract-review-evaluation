3. Detailed Processor Obligations: Article 3 outlines specific responsibilities
4. Strong Security Provisions: Article 5 mandates robust security measures
5. Breach Notification Clause: Article 8 requires prompt notification within 72 hours
6. Audit Rights: Article 7 allows Controller to verify compliance

Notable Provisions:

- Requires processor (SecureData Services) to:
  * Process data only on Controller's instructions
