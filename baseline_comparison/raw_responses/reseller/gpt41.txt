Here's a professional review of your **Reseller Agreement** highlighting key points, strengths, and potential issues or considerations for both parties. This is not legal advice, but a business-oriented and risk-focused overview:

---

## **Strengths & Well-Drafted Clauses**

1. **Clear Definitions (Article 1):** The agreement opens with relevant, concise definitions, which helps avoid ambiguity.

2. **Non-Exclusivity (2.2):** Vendor maintains the right to appoint other resellers and sell directly, supporting its channel strategy.

3. **Order and Fulfillment Process (3):** Provides timeframes (three business days) and methods for ordering, which is good for predictability.

4. **Pricing Change Notice (4.1):** Vendor must give 30 days’ advance written notice of price/discount changes, a fair and common practice.

5. **Payment Terms (5.1):** 30-day net, with a clear late fee (1.5% per month), protects Vendor’s receivables.

6. **Marketing and Trademark Use (6.2/6.3):** Requires approval for material changes and ties trademark use to compliance with guidelines.

7. **Training and Support (7):** Specifies both sides’ duties—Vendor trains, Reseller provides first-level support.

8. **Quarterly Reports (8):** Light but regular reporting (quarterly) can help Vendor with sales forecasting.

9. **Termination for Cause (9.2):** Standard cure period (30 days) strikes a fair balance.

10. **Confidentiality (10):** Reasonable timeframe (3 years).

11. **Warranties & Disclaimers (11):** Appropriately limits Vendor’s obligations and excludes all but explicit warranties.

12. **Limitation of Liability (12):** Caps liability; excludes indirect damages, which is customary.

13. **Governing Law & Arbitration (13):** Specifies Washington law; arbitration in Seattle—this can simplify/lower the cost of disputes.

## **Possible Issues and Recommendations**

### **For Reseller**

1. **Price/Discount Changes (4.1):**
   - **Risk:** Vendor can change prices/discounts and product offerings at discretion (with notice).
   - **Mitigation:** Consider negotiating for longer notice (e.g., 60 days for significant increases), or price protection for deals already quoted (grandfathering).
   - **Downstream Quotes:** What if Reseller has quoted End Users? Consider a clause protecting pre-existing quotations from sudden price hikes.

2. **No Right to Terminate for Convenience (9.1):**
   - **Risk:** Locked in for minimum two years with no early exit except for cause.
   - **Mitigation:** If market changes (e.g. better alternatives, poor Vendor performance not amounting to "material breach"), Reseller is "trapped." Reseller may wish to negotiate a mutual right to terminate for convenience after the first year, or with a short notice period (e.g., 60–90 days).

3. **Sales Reporting (8):**
   - **Privacy:** Ensure information provided does not violate customer confidentiality, especially if End User information is sensitive.

4. **Credit Terms (5.2):**
   - **Risk:** Vendor can change credit limits at will and require prepayment.
   - **Mitigation:** Negotiate predictable, reasonable criteria for changing credit terms.

5. **Support Obligations (7.2):**
   - **Support burden:** Reseller provides first-level support—it should ensure capacity and resources, and Vendor should provide sufficient escalation help.

6. **Arbitration Location (13.2):**
   - **Convenience:** Arbitration in Seattle may be inconvenient/expensive for the California-based Reseller. Consider virtual arbitration or a mutually convenient location.

7. **Assignment (13.3):**
   - **Exit/Aquisition:** Neither party may assign without consent. Can slow down M&A or corporate restructuring. Reseller may want assignment permitted as part of sale of all or substantially all assets or to affiliates.

### **For Vendor**

1. **IP Control (6.2/6.3):**
   - **Brand protection:** Well-addressed with prior approval for changes and adherence to brand guidelines.

2. **Reseller Conduct:**
   - **No explicit code of conduct or compliance clause:** Consider a clause to ensure Reseller complies with applicable laws, export controls, anti-corruption.

### **For Both Parties**

- **Exhibits "to be attached":** Ensure Exhibits A (Products) and B (Pricing/Discounts) are finalized and attached; agreement is incomplete without these.

- **End User License Agreement (3.3):** Reseller must ensure End Users accept Vendor’s EULA—ensure the process for doing this is clear, or else risk of End User disputing terms.

- **Limitation of Liability Carveouts (12.1):**
    - **Customary Exclusions:** The contract excludes indirect damages, but does **not** specify carve-outs (e.g. for breaches of confidentiality, IP infringement, payment obligations). Consider whether this is sufficient for both parties’ risk profiles.

- **Confidentiality duration:** Three years is typical but may be short for trade secrets; if highly sensitive IP is involved, consider longer or perpetual for trade secrets.

- **Vendor:** Consider adding compliance requirements; carefully limit carve-outs on liability.

- **Both Parties:** Do not sign until Exhibits A & B are finalized and attached.
