Here's a comprehensive review of the Reseller Agreement:

Strengths:
1. Clear structure and comprehensive coverage of key aspects of the reseller relationship
2. Defines important terms and scope of the agreement
3. Addresses critical areas like pricing, marketing, support, and termination
4. Includes important legal protections for both parties

Key Provisions to Note:
- Non-exclusive reseller arrangement (Vendor can sell directly and appoint other resellers)
- Two-year initial term with automatic one-year renewals
- 30-day notice for price modifications
- Quarterly sales reporting requirement
- Limited trademark usage license
- Arbitration for dispute resolution

Potential Considerations/Potential Improvements:
1. Confidentiality Period (10.1): Three-year confidentiality period might be longer than typical
2. Termination (9.2): 30-day cure period for material breach is standard but could be negotiated
3. Liability Limitation (12.2): Total liability cap might be restrictive
4. Exhibits A and B are not fully completed in this draft

Recommended Actions:
- Carefully review Exhibits A and B before signing
- Negotiate specific details of product list and pricing
- Consider legal review, especially liability and confidentiality clauses
- Clarify specific marketing support and training details

Overall, this appears to be a well-drafted, balanced reseller agreement with standard protections and clear expectations for both parties.
