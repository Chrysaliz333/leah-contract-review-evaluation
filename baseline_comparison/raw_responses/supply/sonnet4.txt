## Contract Review: Supply Agreement SA-2025-078

### Overall Assessment
This is a well-structured automotive supply agreement with comprehensive coverage of key commercial terms. However, there are several areas that require attention and improvement.

---

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. **Missing Exhibits (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- Exhibits A, B, and C are referenced throughout but not provided
- Without these exhibits, the contract is essentially unenforceable
- **Recommendation**: Ensure all exhibits are completed and attached before execution

### 2. **Incomplete Effective Date**
- The effective date field is blank
- **Recommendation**: Fill in the specific date before signing

---

## Significant Concerns

### 3. **Ambiguous Purchase Commitment**
- Section 2.1 creates mutual obligations but lacks minimum purchase requirements
- Forecasts are non-binding (Section 2.3), creating uncertainty for Supplier
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding minimum purchase commitments or take-or-pay provisions

### 4. **Broad Warranty Disclaimer**
- Section 5.3 disclaims implied warranties including merchantability and fitness for purpose
- May be problematic in automotive industry where strict quality standards are expected
- **Recommendation**: Consider more limited disclaimer or industry-standard warranty terms

### 5. **Unilateral Price Adjustment Rights**
- Section 3.2 allows only Supplier to adjust prices
- No protection for Buyer against cost increases beyond 5%
- **Recommendation**: Add provisions for price decreases when costs decline, or mutual price adjustment mechanisms

---

## Moderate Concerns

### 6. **Force Majeure Clause**
- Section 15.1 lacks detail on notice requirements and mitigation efforts
- No provision for contract termination if force majeure extends beyond reasonable period
- **Recommendation**: Add specific notice periods and termination rights for extended force majeure

### 7. **Quality Requirements**
- Section 8.1 requires ISO 9001 "or IATF 16949" - IATF 16949 should be mandatory for automotive suppliers
- **Recommendation**: Require IATF 16949 certification specifically

### 8. **Limitation of Liability**
- Section 11.2 caps Supplier liability at 12 months of payments
- May be insufficient for automotive applications where defects can cause significant damages
- **Recommendation**: Consider higher caps or exceptions for gross negligence/willful misconduct

---

## Minor Issues

### 9. **Intellectual Property**
- Section 9.1 could be clearer about restrictions on Supplier's use of Buyer's IP
- **Recommendation**: Add explicit prohibition on use for other customers

### 10. **Insurance Requirements**
- Coverage amounts may be insufficient for automotive industry risks
- **Recommendation**: Consider higher limits and add automotive-specific coverage requirements

### 11. **Termination Provisions**
- 180-day notice for convenience termination may be excessive
- **Recommendation**: Consider 90-120 day notice period
