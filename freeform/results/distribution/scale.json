The proposed redline for 3.1 converts non-exclusive to exclusive appointment, prohibiting Supplier from selling directly or appointing other distributors without Distributor's consent (except for mutually agreed strategic accounts). The redline for 3.2 restricts Supplier's direct sales to cases where Distributor first declines/fails to supply, prohibits additional distributors without consent, and requires contractual restrictions on outside-Territory resales. This comprehensively addresses all GT key elements: exclusive territory OR exclusive product lines, limitation on direct Supplier competition, and protection of Distributor-sourced leads."

The proposed redline adds constraints: price increases limited to annual aggregate of 5% (except for documented raw material/duty/tax increases), 60-day notice (already in place), and Distributor may terminate affected purchase orders placed after notice if increase exceeds 5% in any 12-month period.

Failure to agree and cure within 90 days becomes grounds for termination (not automatic breach).

For all other assignments, Supplier's consent is still required.

This addresses GT key elements: increase to 24+ months (via $500K floor which likely exceeds typical annual spend), carve-outs for critical claims and indemnification obligations, though the GT also suggests considering higher cap for Supplier. Strong amendment with meaningful floor."
