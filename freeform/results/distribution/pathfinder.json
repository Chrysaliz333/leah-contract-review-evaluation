The proposed redline for 3.1 converts to exclusive distribution, and the redline for 3.2 narrows Supplier's reserved rights to prevent channel conflict. Both amendments comprehensively address all GT key elements: exclusive territory OR exclusive product lines, limit direct Supplier competition, and protect Distributor's investment. The rationale explains market protection and ROI justification. Quality is high across all dimensions."
