Proposed redlines convert 3.1 to exclusive distribution during the Term (subject to minimum purchases) and restrict 3.2 to limit Supplier's direct sales to specific government/strategic accounts in Exhibit E, with appointments limited to non-territory/non-core lines in Exhibit F. This comprehensively addresses all GT key elements: exclusive territory grant (tied to performance), limits on direct Supplier competition, and protection of Distributor investments. The amendments are precise and well-structured."

The proposed redline requires mutual written agreement for price changes, establishes annual increase caps at the lesser of 3% or CPI increase, provides price protection for accepted orders during notice period, and grants termination right for committed purchase orders if increase exceeds 5% in any 12-month period. This addresses all GT key elements: price cap (CPI or 5% annual max), longer notice period (implicit in mutual agreement), and right to terminate on material price increase.

The proposed redline reduces the minimum to $75K per quarter (from $100K), ties minimums to exclusive territory grant and performance metrics, adds force majeure and documented market downturn exceptions, establishes graduated minimums for initial years (50% Year 1, 75% Year 2, 100% Year 3+), and provides 60-day cure period with remediation plan before breach declaration. This comprehensively addresses all GT key elements: reduced minimum, cure period, good faith negotiation, and market condition adjustment. The amendment is thorough and commercially balanced."

This addresses all GT key elements: mutual assignment provisions, M&A/affiliate exception, and consent reasonableness standard. The amendment balances corporate flexibility with protections."

This addresses all GT key elements: deemed approval if no response within 10 business days, limitation to major campaigns (those prominently featuring trademarks), and pre-approval of standard templates.

This addresses all GT key elements: Supplier buyback at cost for remaining inventory (85% recovery), transition period for customer handover (cooperation clause), and refund considerations (warranty/return support).
