        "reasoning": "Starliner identified both 3.1 and 3.2 with checkmark (unfavorable) classifications. The proposed redline for 3.1 converts to exclusive distribution, prohibiting Supplier from appointing other distributors or selling directly/indirectly within the Territory without Distributor's consent during the Term. The redline for 3.2 removes Supplier's broad reservation and requires consent for direct sales, prohibits overlapping distributor appointments, and requires contractual restrictions on out-of-territory customers reselling into Territory. This comprehensively addresses all GT key elements: exclusive territory grant, limits on direct Supplier competition, and protection of Distributor investments."

The proposed redline requires that Supplier 'may not increase prices by more than five percent (5%) per calendar year', provides 'at least ninety (90) days' prior written notice of any price changes', and makes increases 'subject to Distributor's written agreement'. This addresses all GT key elements: price cap (5% annual max), longer notice period (90 days vs 60), and right to refuse material increases (via required agreement).

This addresses GT key elements: M&A/affiliate exception and obligation assumption by assignee.

This addresses GT key elements: increase to 24+ months (via $500K floor), carve-outs for IP/willful misconduct/gross negligence, and carve-outs for critical categories. The $500K floor provides meaningful protection."

Placement is after Article 10.

This addresses all GT key elements: deemed approval if no response within 10 business days (5 days is even better), limitation to major campaigns (materials using trademarks/branding), and reasonableness standard.

This addresses GT key elements by requiring objective rejection criteria and written justification, which supports supply assurance.
