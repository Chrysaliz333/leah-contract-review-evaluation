        "reasoning": "Pioneer Deep identifies both 3.1 and 3.2 in the risk table with checkmarks (favorable classification). The proposed redline for 3.2 restricts Supplier's reserved rights to mutually agreed strategic accounts and prohibits overlapping distributors without consent. However, the redline for 3.1 focuses on approval criteria for Approved Resellers rather than converting to exclusive distribution. The amendments partially address the GT issue by restricting direct sales and limiting competitor appointments, but don't fully achieve exclusive territory OR exclusive product lines as the GT specifies. Partial credit awarded."

The proposed redline caps price increases at once per calendar quarter with a maximum 5% per change, extends notice to 60 days (original was already 60, so no change), and requires honoring accepted POs and quoted prices. This addresses all GT key elements: price cap (5% vs CPI or 5% annual max), accepted orders honored, and limits frequency. Amendment quality is excellent with specific caps and protections."

The proposed redline ties quarterly purchase targets to mutually agreed rolling forecasts and market conditions, replaces automatic breach with remediation plan requirement, and excludes failures due to demand fluctuations, supply constraints, or force majeure. This comprehensively addresses all GT concerns: reduced minimum or adjustable based on performance, cure period (60 days to make up shortfall via remediation plan), negotiation rights before breach, and market condition adjustment."

The proposed redline increases the cap to 200% (2×) of annual spend and adds carve-outs for indemnification obligations, gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct, and breach of Article 12 (confidentiality). This addresses GT key elements: increased to 24+ months (200% = 2× 12 months), carve-outs for critical claims and indemnification, though the GT suggests considering higher cap for Supplier.

The proposed redline adds 'deemed acceptance if no response', confirmed lead times, and partial acceptance rules. However, it does not add 'shall not unreasonably reject' language or explicit supply assurance for forecasted quantities as the GT requires. The amendment addresses the deemed acceptance mechanism and some supply assurance (confirmed lead times), but misses the 'no obligation to accept orders even within forecast' concern and the need for supply commitment.
