        "reasoning": "Velocity identified both 3.1 and 3.2 with checkmark classifications in the risk table. The proposed redline for 3.1 converts to 'the exclusive distributor of the Products within the Territory during the Term, conditioned on Distributor's compliance with the Minimum Purchase Commitment', with explicit carve-outs for specific government/strategic accounts (Exhibit E) and non-territory/non-core product lines (Exhibit F). The redline for 3.2 restricts Supplier's reserved rights to cases 'where Distributor fails to meet minimum performance standards or as required for regulatory/commercial exceptions'. This comprehensively addresses all GT key elements: exclusive territory grant (performance-linked), limits on direct Supplier competition, and protection of Distributor investments with clear carve-outs."

The proposed redline caps price increases at '[X]% per twelve-month rolling period', requires price changes to 'apply uniformly to all Distributor partners', extends notice to 60 days (already in place), and prevents retroactive application to 'orders already accepted by Supplier'. This addresses GT key elements: price cap (cap specified though placeholder [X]%), longer notice period (60 days maintained), and protection for accepted orders. The amendment provides predictability and equal treatment, though the placeholder [X]% should be negotiated (GT suggests CPI or 5%)."

The proposed redline maintains the $100K minimum but adds 'subject to reasonable adjustment for Territory market conditions', requires 'Supplier has first offered a cure period of one (1) additional quarter or an alternative product mix adjustment to help meet targets' before breach declaration, and provides flexibility for 'force majeure-like disruptions'. This addresses all GT key elements: adjustment for market conditions, cure period (one additional quarter), negotiation rights (alternative product mix), and protection from events beyond control.

The proposed redline maintains the 12-month cap but carves out: '(i) claims arising from IP infringement, (ii) breaches of confidentiality, (iii) data protection/privacy violations, or (iv) product recalls or safety-related liabilities'. This addresses GT key elements: carve-outs for critical claims (IP, willful misconduct via product recalls/safety, confidentiality), and carve-outs for indemnification obligations (implicit in product recalls/IP). While the amendment doesn't increase the cap to 24+ months, the comprehensive carve-outs significantly improve Distributor protection for high-risk scenarios."

The proposed revision requires Supplier to 'defend, at its own expense, Distributor against any third-party claim that the Products or its use infringes a valid third-party patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right', indemnify for 'damages finally awarded', and if infringement occurs, 'replace or modify the product to avoid infringement or procure a license at Supplier's expense'. Placement is after Article 13 as new Article 14. This addresses GT IP infringement protection and defense costs. However, it focuses on IP and doesn't explicitly cover product liability (design/manufacturing defects), which is also a GT concern. Strong IP indemnity but partial coverage of full GT scope."

This addresses GT key elements: DDP or CIF terms (DAP is close to DDP but Distributor bears import duties), Supplier-arranged transportation, and modernizes with Incoterms 2020. The amendment significantly reduces Distributor's transit risk, though full DDP would be even stronger."
