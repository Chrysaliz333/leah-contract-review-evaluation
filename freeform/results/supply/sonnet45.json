The risk table flags 'Termination for Cause' as 'Clarify' noting '30-day cure period may be too long if Supplier delivers critically defective products' and recommending 'expedited termination rights for critical failures.' The proposed redline maintains the 30-day cure for ordinary breaches but adds immediate termination rights for: safety defects/production shutdowns, repeated quality failures (3 in 6 months), insurance lapses, insolvency, and confidentiality breaches. Comprehensively addresses all GT key elements about shorter cure for supply/quality breaches and immediate termination for safety-critical defects."
