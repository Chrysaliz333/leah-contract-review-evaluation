The risk table classifies 11.2 as 'Favorable' but notes 'may leave Apex under-compensated for serious defects, recalls, or IP/data breach damages' and recommends raising cap or adding carve-outs. The proposed redline adds a $2M floor but notably does NOT extend to 24 months or add carve-outs for willful misconduct, indemnification, or IP.
