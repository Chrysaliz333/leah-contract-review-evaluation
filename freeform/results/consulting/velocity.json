Making ownership immediate upon creation and adding an assignment fallback ensures Client obtains full IP rights regardless of work-for-hire status, while payment remains a separate contractual obligation.",
        "judge_reasoning": "Risk table flags ownership as Requires Clarification, noting work-for-hire may not apply to independent contractors and payment contingency creates leverage. Proposed redline addresses work-for-hire limitations by adding explicit assignment language as fallback and making ownership immediate upon creation, removing payment contingency. GT calls for addressing work-for-hire ineffectiveness with express assignment fallback. Redline comprehensively addresses GT structural concern by providing dual mechanism (work-for-hire + assignment) and immediate vesting.
