In the event of any dispute arising under this Agreement, the Partners shall first attempt to resolve the dispute through good faith negotiation. If the dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days, the Partners shall proceed to mediation before a mutually agreed mediator in New York, New York. If the dispute remains unresolved after mediation, the matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with Section 13.2.",
        "effective_rationale_excerpt": "While the contract provides for negotiation and arbitration, it lacks a structured escalation process, which could lead to unnecessary arbitration. Adding mediation as an intermediate step encourages amicable resolution. Placement: To be inserted as a new section in Article 13 (Dispute Resolution).",
        "judge_reasoning": "Leah partially detected the dispute resolution concern. The proposed clause adds structure (30-day negotiation timeline, mediation in New York) which addresses some GT concerns. However, Leah's reasoning states the contract 'lacks a structured escalation process', when in fact the contract already has negotiation → mediation → arbitration per clauses 11.1-11.3. The GT issue is that negotiation has no timeline and could delay urgent resolution. Leah's proposal adds the timeline but doesn't address emergency arbitration option. Detection: P (addressed structure but misunderstood existing provisions). Amendment 2/3: adds useful timeline. Rationale 2/3: identifies need for structure but mischaracterizes existing provisions. Redline quality 2/3: clear language."
