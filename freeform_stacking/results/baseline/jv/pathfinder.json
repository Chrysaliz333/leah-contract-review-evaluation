Leah adds change-of-control termination right as part of Termination for Cause amendment, specifically 'change of control to a competitor of the terminating Party.' This addresses the GT concern about competitor acquisition but does not include notice requirement, consent rights, or buyout option at FMV. The trigger is narrow (competitor only) versus GT's broader CoC concern. Detected core risk but incomplete on remedies beyond termination."
