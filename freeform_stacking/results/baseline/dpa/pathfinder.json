Processor shall submit a written request identifying the proposed Sub-processor at least forty-five (45) days in advance and shall not proceed until consent is granted. Controller may withhold consent at its sole discretion and, if consent is withheld, may terminate the Principal Agreement without penalty.",

The proposed revision reinstates strict consent, extends notice to 45 days for due diligence, and adds a termination right, reflecting EDPB Guidelines 07/2020 and empowering Controller to police its supply chain.",
        "judge_reasoning": "Leah's 4.1 amendment addresses the sub-processor authorization mechanism but does not explicitly require population of Exhibit C or address the blank list problem. The shift to prior written consent model means individual sub-processors are approved case-by-case rather than listed upfront, which functionally addresses the gap but in a different way than expected. The risk table flags 4.1 as ❌ for authorization weakness but does not separately flag the blank Exhibit C as a distinct issue. Partial detection: Leah solved the underlying problem (Controller control of sub-processors) but not via the expected path (populating Exhibit C baseline list). Amendment score 2: addresses the control gap but not the transparency/due diligence aspect of having a known baseline. Rationale score 2: focuses on authorization mechanism, not baseline list requirement. Redline quality 3: well-drafted for what it addresses."

        "effective_rationale_excerpt": "New Clause – Processor Cyber Insurance... No insurance obligation; increases recovery risk. [...] Insurance is a core risk-mitigation tool. By mandating GBP 5 m coverage, Controller gains confidence in Processor's ability to satisfy potential judgments or regulatory fines. Advance notice of cancellation enables Controller to act before coverage lapses, strongly protecting Controller's position.",
        "judge_reasoning": "Leah detected this missing T2 clause and proposed cyber insurance requirement. The amendment adds GBP 5M cyber and professional indemnity insurance, certificate provision on request, and 30-day cancellation notice - comprehensively addressing all key elements (score 3). Rationale identifies recovery risk, Processor financial ability concern, and advance notice benefits (score 3). Does not mention Controller as additional insured but this is a minor gap. Redline includes clear placement guidance (after 9.2) and is immediately usable (score 3). Excellent new clause recommendation."
