The issue is structural: the canonical JSON lacks the required format for Part A evaluation (no is_redline_stacking: true entries, no redline_clause_language fields capturing exact CP language).

Leah correctly identified critical issues including missing indemnification (T1), warranty disclaimers (T1), unilateral pricing (T1), no TfC (T1), and multiple T2 concerns. The two NMI items are: (1) GT-06 baseline interest rate - Leah discussed payment terms but focused on CP redline's worse version (2% interest) rather than identifying baseline 1.5% as already high; (2) GT-13 support SLAs - Leah classified 7.2 as Favorable focusing on role allocation clarity rather than absence of performance metrics. Both NMI items are understandable omissions rather than critical oversights.",

Notable findings include: exhibits attachment gaps (1.3, 6.3), EULA enforcement burden (3.3), confidentiality period concerns (10.1 - GT candidate), governing law/venue disadvantages (13.1, 13.2), and assignment restrictions (13.3 - GT candidate). Several issues overlap appropriately with GT items (11.1 overlaps warranty concern with GT-04, 1.1 discount definition relates to GT-01 pricing).",
    "part_a_cp_redline_awareness": "While Part A scores 0 due to structural issues, the evidence shows Leah correctly understood all 4 CP redlines: (1) RESELLER_01 - identified 7-day notice as 'even less favorable' than baseline 30 days; (2) RESELLER_02 - identified all three CP changes (15-day terms, 2% interest, suspension); (3) RESELLER_03 - identified both CP changes (1-year term, asymmetric Vendor-only TfC); (4) RESELLER_04 - identified CP reduction to 'lesser of product amount or $25,000'. All recommendations correctly stated 'reject redline'."
