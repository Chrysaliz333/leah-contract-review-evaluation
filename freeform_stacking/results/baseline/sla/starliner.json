  "notes": "Starliner performed excellently on Part B (whole document review) with 90.8% and perfect T1 gate pass. However, Part A (CP redline response) performance was extremely weak at 8.3%. Leah identified the issues created by CP redlines in the risk table but failed to provide explicit REJECT actions with baseline reversions. The model appears to treat CP redlines as part of the baseline document rather than as adversarial proposals requiring specific responses. This is a critical gap in CP redline handling. No critical failures flagged in Part A because Leah did not explicitly ACCEPT the problematic redlines - they were simply not addressed as CP redline responses (NMI pattern rather than wrong action). Part B detection was comprehensive with 20/26 issues detected (all 8 T1 issues, 9/12 T2 issues, 3/6 T3 issues). Quality scores were consistently high (mostly 2s across all dimensions). The 6 NMI items in Part B were: GT-10 (annual advance payment), GT-15 (auto-renewal), GT-19 (survival incomplete), GT-21 (no BC/DR), GT-23 (no insurance requirements), GT-26 (short maintenance notice)."
