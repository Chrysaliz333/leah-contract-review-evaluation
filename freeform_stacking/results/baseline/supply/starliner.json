Part A (CP redlines): Perfect score (100%), correctly rejecting all four unfavorable CP redlines with comprehensive reversions and strong reasoning. Part B (whole document): 89.9%, detecting 10/14 issues with T1 gate passed (4/4 detected). Three misses: GT-08 (indemnification recall costs - T2), GT-09 (high interest rate - T3), GT-14 (termination cure period asymmetry - T2). Notable strengths include excellent detection of FCA delivery risk, consequential damages exclusion, and missing insurance/business continuity provisions. The additional issue ADD-04 (data protection gap) is a legitimate GT candidate for future versions."
