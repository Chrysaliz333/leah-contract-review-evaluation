The proposed_redlines array includes an entry for 'Effect of Termination' (11.3) that identifies the lack of inventory buyback or return rights despite the 90-day sell-off period. The proposed remediation is to add inventory buyback or return rights. This directly addresses the GT's first suggested remediation: 'Should add Supplier buyback at cost for remaining inventory'. The rationale acknowledges the 90-day sell-off period and identifies the gap regarding unsold inventory after that period. While the proposal does not address transition assistance or refund of prepaid amounts (other GT elements), it targets the primary issue. Amendment score: 2 (proposes buyback/return rights, addressing the primary GT concern, though does not cover transition assistance or prepaid refunds). Rationale score: 2 (identifies 90-day period and lack of buyback process for remaining inventory). Redline quality score: 2 (clear proposed amendment with buyback or return mechanism)."

Leah's risk_table entry for clause 4.1 'Purchase Orders' is marked as ✅ Favorable with the reasoning: 'Supplier must accept/reject orders within 5 business days; this provides clarity and predictability.' This represents a mischaracterisation of the risk. The GT issue is that Supplier can reject each purchase order at will, creating supply uncertainty despite Distributor's minimum purchase commitment. Leah views the 5-day response time as providing clarity, but does not recognise that the ability to reject orders is asymmetric (Distributor commits to minimums but Supplier does not commit to supply). There is no proposed_redline entry for clause 4.1, and no mention of adding deemed acceptance, supply assurance, or restricting rejection rights. The issue was not identified. Detection: NMI."

Leah's risk_table entry for clause 3.3 'Sales Outside Territory' is marked as ✅ Favorable with the reasoning: 'Reasonable restriction to protect Supplier's market segmentation.' This indicates Leah did not identify the GT concern that territory restrictions may limit Distributor's growth opportunities and that passive sales outside the Territory should be permitted. The GT characterises this as a T3 (minor) issue requiring clarification or amendment to ensure passive sales are allowed. Leah's assessment that this is 'reasonable' and favourable to Supplier's interests suggests the issue was recognised but dismissed as acceptable, which constitutes an affirmative determination of compliance rather than an oversight. Detection: N (marked as Favorable when GT expects ⚠️)."

The proposed_redlines array includes an entry for 'Exclusion of Damages' (10.1) that identifies the broad exclusion of all indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages as potentially too broad and leaving Distributor with inadequate remedies. The proposed remediation is to allow recovery of certain consequential damages, especially for Supplier's willful misconduct or gross negligence. This addresses one of the GT's key carve-out requirements (willful misconduct/gross negligence). While the proposal does not explicitly mention carve-outs for confidentiality breach, IP infringement, or indemnification obligations (other GT elements), it demonstrates understanding that the mutual exclusion is too broad and proposes a reasonable protective carve-out. Amendment score: 2 (proposes carve-out for willful misconduct/gross negligence, addressing a key GT element, though not comprehensive across all suggested carve-outs). Rationale score: 2 (identifies breadth of exclusion and inadequacy of remedies, though does not discuss lost profits from product defects, supply failures, or opportunity costs specific to distribution relationships).
