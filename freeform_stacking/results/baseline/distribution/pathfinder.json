        "judge_reasoning": "Leah identified clause 3.3 (Sales Outside Territory) but classified it as Favorable with no action recommended. The GT flags this as a T3 issue because the restriction on establishing operations outside Territory may limit growth opportunities. Leah's reading is that passive sales are permitted, which is correct, but the GT expects at least a ⚠️ classification or a recommendation to ensure passive sales are explicitly protected. Since Leah marked it Favorable and took no action, this is a partial detection: the clause was reviewed and understood, but the growth limitation concern was not flagged. Award P detection (0.5 points for T3), no quality scores."

The risk table identifies the lack of carve-outs and the risk of uncompensated losses from breaches or recalls. The proposed fix adds carve-outs for IP infringement, gross negligence, and product liability, which addresses three of the GT's key elements. The GT also expects carve-outs for breach of confidentiality and indemnification obligations, which are not mentioned, so amendment score is 2. The rationale explains the lost profits bar and breach/recall scenarios. Detection and remediation are strong, though not fully comprehensive."
