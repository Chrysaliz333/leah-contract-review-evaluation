The GT expects amendment to allocate returns pro rata to capital or add preferred return to larger contributor. Leah's position is to retain the 50/50 split 'because it strongly benefits us', which is correct from a negotiating perspective representing Partner B, but doesn't address the structural fairness/alignment issue that the GT flags.

Leah identifies that five-year survival may be too short for sensitive data and proposes extending to ten years with perpetual protection for trade secrets. All GT key elements addressed: 5-year survival period, investment partnership involves proprietary deal flow/strategies, trade secrets have indefinite value, 5 years insufficient for competitive protection, should add perpetual protection for trade secrets, should differentiate trade secrets from general confidential info. The rationale explains proprietary information protection, market norms alignment, and balanced approach. The redline clearly distinguishes trade secrets (indefinite) from other confidential information (10 years). Full marks."

        "effective_rationale_excerpt": "The original one-year notice window is unnecessarily long, limiting our strategic flexibility. Introducing a 180-day convenience termination right after year two gives Growth Dynamics Partners LP a predictable, shorter off-ramp. This balances commitment stability with exit flexibility, aligning with private-equity market practice.",
        "judge_reasoning": "Partial detection. Leah identifies that the notice period limits flexibility and proposes reducing it from one year (12 months) to 180 days. However, the GT issue is about the non-renewal notice being too short at 90 days (per the baseline GT's clause 10.2), not too long. There appears to be a discrepancy: the stacking GT references '10.2' but Leah's risk table addresses '12.1' which mentions '12-month notice' (not 90 days). Looking at the baseline GT-12, the contract text states 'ninety (90) days prior' for non-renewal. Leah's proposed 180-day notice actually addresses the GT concern by extending the notice period (from 90 to 180 days), providing more time for wind-down planning. Award P for partial detection: Leah recognises the notice period issue and proposes 180 days (which would address the GT concern), but frames it as reducing from '12-month' rather than extending from 90 days. The key elements are partially addressed: extends notice period, adds transition flexibility, but doesn't explicitly mention wind-down procedures or planning requirements."
