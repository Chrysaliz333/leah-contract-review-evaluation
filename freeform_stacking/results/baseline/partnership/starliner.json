However, Leah does not identify the critical flaw: the cross-reference to Section 10.3 is incorrect—10.3 is 'Effect of Termination', not default provisions. The proposed revision adds detail (voting rights loss, dilution, discounted buyout) which addresses part of the concern, but perpetuates the erroneous cross-reference by still referencing 'Section 10.3' and stating consequences are 'as further detailed in Section 10.3' when no such details exist there.

The evaluation focuses almost entirely on rejecting the CP redline (60/40 split with losses to B first), which Leah correctly identifies as highly unfavorable. However, Leah does not recognize the GT's core concern with the baseline clause itself: that a fixed 50/50 split 'regardless of the relative capital contributions' creates economic misalignment when partners contribute different amounts of capital. The proposed revision preserves the 50/50 split and adds mutual consent for changes, which protects against the CP redline but does not address the fundamental GT issue (should allocate returns pro rata to capital or add preferred return to larger contributor). The rationale praises equal sharing as 'fair and standard' without acknowledging the mismatch risk when contributions differ. Partial detection awarded because the clause is flagged and discussed, but the underlying structural problem identified by GT is not addressed.

While Leah extensively discusses rejecting the CP redline at 9.1 (which imposes one-sided confidentiality), and proposes restoring mutual confidentiality with a 5-year survival period, there is no recognition that even the original 5-year survival may be inadequate for trade secrets (deal flow, investment strategies) which have indefinite value. The proposed revision maintains the 5-year limit without addressing the GT concern about perpetual protection for trade secrets or differentiating trade secrets from general confidential information. The entire focus is on mutuality and balance, not on the survival period's adequacy for proprietary information. The GT issue is a separate concern from the CP redline and is not addressed.
