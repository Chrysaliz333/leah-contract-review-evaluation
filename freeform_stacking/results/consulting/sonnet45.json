      "overall_assessment": "Strong performance across both Part A (CP redlines) and Part B (whole document). Perfect score on Part A with all 4 CP redlines correctly identified and REJECT recommended with comprehensive reasoning. Part B shows excellent detection with 9/11 issues fully detected and 2 partial detections. The T1 issue (work-for-hire ineffectiveness) was partially detected - Leah identified the IP ownership concern but focused on the CP redline reversal rather than the inherent statutory limitation of work-for-hire for independent contractors. Overall, a high-quality evaluation demonstrating thorough contract review capabilities."
