No specification of rejection grounds, allocation priorities during shortages, or minimum acceptance obligations. Absence of binding forecast mechanism prevents production planning coordination.",
        "judge_reasoning": "Leah correctly identifies clause 4.1 as requiring clarification and addresses all GT key elements: Supplier can accept/reject each PO at discretion, no obligation to accept even within forecast, supply uncertainty. The proposed revision adds objective rejection criteria, deemed acceptance mechanism, and supply assurance for performing distributors (120% of average) - directly addressing GT's call for acceptance requirement within agreed capacity/forecast. The concepts of reject, discretion, and no obligation are all explicitly addressed. Comprehensive detection and strong remediation."

Distributor prohibited from active solicitation outside Territory while Supplier faces no corresponding limitations under 3.2. 'Actively solicit' undefined - unclear if passive orders, online advertising, or trade show participation constitute violations. Prohibition on branch/warehouse establishment without consent prevents operational efficiency.",
        "judge_reasoning": "Leah correctly identifies clause 3.3 as Unfavorable and addresses GT key elements: active solicitation prohibition, facility establishment restriction, growth limitations. The proposed revision explicitly permits passive/unsolicited orders outside Territory (addressing GT's point), adds reasonableness standard for facility approval, permits trade shows and online marketing. The definition of 'actively solicit' is narrowed to targeted direct efforts, explicitly excluding passive orders - directly addressing GT's concern about passive sales being permitted.

Distributor's primary risk (lost profits from supply interruptions, defective products, or wrongful termination) falls within excluded consequential damages. Supplier's primary risk (direct product liability) remains recoverable as direct damages. Exclusion may be unenforceable for gross negligence or willful misconduct but contract lacks this carve-out.",
        "judge_reasoning": "Leah correctly identifies clause 10.1 as requiring amendment and addresses all GT key elements: blanket exclusion blocks recovery for lost profits from product defects/supply failures, no carve-out for indemnification/confidentiality/willful misconduct/IP. The proposed revision adds carve-outs for gross negligence/willful misconduct/fraud, confidentiality breach, IP infringement, and indemnification obligations - exactly matching GT's expected remediation. The rationale correctly identifies the asymmetric impact on Distributor. Comprehensive detection with well-drafted carve-outs."
