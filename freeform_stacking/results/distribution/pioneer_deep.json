IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO A PARTY'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS, INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, OR A PARTY'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.",

Distributor needs carve-outs for key risks. Standard carve-outs ensure Distributor can recover for the most significant risks.",

This addresses all GT key elements about adding carve-outs for confidentiality breach, IP infringement, willful misconduct, and indemnification obligations. Complete detection with comprehensive, well-drafted carve-out structure."
