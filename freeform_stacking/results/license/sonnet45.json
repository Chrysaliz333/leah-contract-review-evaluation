All GT key elements addressed: (1) Licensor can audit annually - addressed via frequency limitation; (2) Licensee bears audit costs if underpayment exceeds 5% - explicitly identified; (3) 5% threshold is relatively low - 'cost-shifting threshold creates dispute risk... could trigger on good-faith calculation differences'; (4) Should increase threshold to 10% - explicitly proposed; (5) Add cap on audit frequency - proposed 'once per year regardless of findings'; (6) Require reasonable advance notice - proposed '30 business days'.
