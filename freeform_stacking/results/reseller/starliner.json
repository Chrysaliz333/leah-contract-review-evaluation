However, Part A fails due to 2 critical failures - Leah did not properly respond to CP redlines at sections 5.1 (payment terms) and 9.1 (term/termination), instead addressing baseline contract text rather than the counterparty's proposed changes. This indicates the model may not be properly parsing or distinguishing CP redlines from original contract text."
